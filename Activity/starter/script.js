/*

  In this assignmenmt you are given a list of student names. The challenge
  is to pair students by how similar their names are in edit distance.
  The pairing algorithm  pseudocode is:

  sort the students by last name (A to Z)
  while there is > 1 unpaired student
    X = the first unpaired student
    if X's first name begins with a vowel
      compute the Hamming distance to all other unpaired students

    if X's first name begins with a consonant
      compute the Levenshtein distance to all other unpaired students

    pair X with the most similar name, Y (ie shortest edit distance). If there
    is a tie in edit distance, sort the results by last name (A...Z) and
    take the first.

    remove X and Y from the list of unpaired students.


  to help you, you are provided with the scripts:
    levenshtein.js and hamming.js

  **THERE IS CURRENTLY A NAMING CONFLICT, solve this by wrapping each
    provided distance funciton the JavaScirpt namespace-like construct of your choice.

    YOU CANNOT SIMPLY RENAME the distance functions!
    YOU CANNOT MODIFY THE distance functions IN ANY WAY other than
    to implement your namespace construct!

    I suggest putting each in it's own unique object so in your main
    code you can write:
     hamming.distance(a,b)
      or
     levenshtein.distance(a,b)

/* STEP 1: SORT NAMES by LAST NAME! */


/* WHILE > 1 students are UNPAIRED
     take 1st student, compute distance to all others,
      pair with lowest score.
