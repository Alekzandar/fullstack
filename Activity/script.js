var string = "Hello";
// string += " World"; // uncomment to test
string = string + " World";
console.log(string + "!");
// This example will print out 'Hello World World!' on the console. However, 
// in the console I got "Hello World" without the section to be uncommented and
// got the expected with that line uncommented.
